# Hardware

Embodying the philosophy of openess and freedom, we intend to expose all the
details of our hardware to the community.

We want you to understand how our devices work and how to interact with them.

## Neeno Devices

So far, there are two versions of the Neeno armband in the wild:

- **Neeno 1**, released in 2023, is still in use by researchers, but
its creation and development has been discontinued. However, you can still find
documentation about it, in case you are one of the holders of such version.

- **Neeno 2**, released in 2024, is the one we are currently focusing on, and
it is the one that will be the subject of most of the documentation you will
find here.
