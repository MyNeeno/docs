# Neeno SDK

## Introduction

Neeno provides open SDKs for developers to build applications on top of the
Neeno platform.

The SDKs help developers to quickly integrate the capabilities of their Neeno
devices into their ecosystems.

By using the SDKs, developers can easily communicate and exchange data within
their platforms.

The core of your Neeno Armband is its firmware. The firmware is responsible for
managing the hardware and providing the necessary interfaces to interact with
the device.

Once you power up your armband it will immediately look for a connection with
your computer or smartphone. If it does not find one, it will go into sleep
mode after some time to save battery.

## Getting Started

To start developing applications with the Neeno SDK, you need to follow these
steps:

1. **Download the SDK**: You can download the SDK from the Neeno GitHub
   repository.

3. **Connect your Neeno device**: Make sure your Neeno device is charged and
    turned on. Connect it to your computer via USB.
