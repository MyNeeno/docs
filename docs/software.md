# Neeno SDK

Welcome to the Neeno SDK! This SDK is designed to help you interact with your
Neeno wearables.

It is a cross-platform solution (Windows, macOS, and Linux) designed to help
you get the most out of your Neeno devices by providing:

- A simple and easy-to-use API to interact with your hardware.
- A way to access the raw data from the sensors.
- Data visualization in real-time.
- Data logging to a file for later analysis.
- Interfaces to major Frameworks and Libraries.

Advanced users can also:

- Customize the firmware of the device.
- Create their own applications using the SDK.
- Compile the SDK from source.

We highly recommend that you join our [Github Community](https://github.com/MyNeeno)
to share your ideas, get help from other developers, and be the first to know
about the newest features and updates.
