# NEENO Documentation

Your hand is a sensor. From now on you have to see it this way.

Once connected to your computer, your hand tells you:

- The orientation and position of your hand relatively to your body.
- The muscle activity of your forearm.

Our question is: What can YOU do with it?

Do you want to control a robot? Play a game? Create music? Draw in 3D? Aid your
rehabilitation? Get insights on your workout? The possibilities are endless.

Here you will find every tool you need to start developing cool applications
with Neeno devices. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out,
we have the resources you need to get started.
